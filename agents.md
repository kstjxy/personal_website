# Agent Notes

- When authoring MDX content under `content/projects`, explicitly import any React components you reference (e.g., `QuickLinks`, `Columns`, `YouTube`) because the MDX provider setup does not auto-inject them at build time.
- Git policy: Do NOT run `git commit`, `git push`, or otherwise publish changes without the user's explicit, formal approval in the current session. Default behavior is to stage or propose changes and wait for confirmation before committing/pushing.
