## Overview

During my 2022 game studio internship I led a three-person pod to build a Texas Hold'em tournament platform for internal AI competitions. Over 50 engineers uploaded bots, so we focused on reliable simulations, clear broadcast UI, and flexible integration points (C#, Lua, WebSocket).

## Tournament Flow

- **Setup:** Administrators pick entrants (uploaded modules or live WebSocket clients) and configure starting chips, blinds, and round limits.
- **Match loop:** The Unity host iterates through betting rounds, calling each bot’s `BetAction` or equivalent hook. Operators can slow down or accelerate matches for debugging.
- **Results:** Standings update automatically, and full logs—including RNG seeds and per-round actions—can be exported for postmortems.

## Integration Options

1. **C# modules:** Drop-in scripts implementing `OnInit`, `BetAction`, and `FinalSelection`. Useful for quick prototypes.
2. **Lua modules:** Mirror the C# API with `startfunction`, `round_start`, `action`, and `finalcards`, accessing shared `gamestat` values from the host.
3. **WebSocket clients:** Communicate with the `WebAI` bridge. Receive serialized state payloads and reply with actions via socket message types.

## My Contributions

- Specced the architecture, task board, and build milestones while mentoring two fellow interns.
- Implemented the Unity host, match scheduler, and replay/logging pipeline.
- Authored sample AI bots and documentation to help new participants onboard quickly.
