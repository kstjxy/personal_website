**In this project, we focuses on creating 3D impossible objects that can be viewed from multiple perspectives. We leveraged the Unreal engine to develop these objects, maintaining their impossibilities as the viewer rotates the model. This research has significant implications in machine vision and design, challenging traditional perspectives in computer graphics. We explored perceptual illusions, impossible geometries, and eye-tracking technology to enhance the VR experience. Our experiments involved intricate manipulations in Unreal Engine to convincingly render 3D impossible objects, while addressing the challenges in translating 2D illusions into 3D space and VR environments.**Click here to access the detailed report:**[READ MORE >>](https://assets.nicepagecdn.com/a7c2be37/6110704/files/VRDesignincontextgroupfinalreport.pdf)**
