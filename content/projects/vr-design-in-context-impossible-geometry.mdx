## Overview

How do you make an "impossible" object feel believable in VR? Our design-in-context study explored that by building camera-dependent sculptures in Unreal Engine. We studied Escher-inspired illusions, replicated them in 3D, then evaluated how users perceive them when they walk around the piece.

## Approach

- Modeled candidate objects whose silhouettes only align from specific viewpoints.
- Authored blueprints that swap meshes and shader cutoff planes based on the user’s head position.
- Used eye-tracking data (on supported headsets) to bias which segments should remain coherent in the player’s foveal region.

## Challenges Learned

- Maintaining the illusion requires tightly controlling parallax; we lerped between hidden proxy meshes as viewers moved.
- Lighting must avoid harsh shadows that reveal the hack—so we leaned on ambient occlusion and stylized gradients instead of direct lights.
- Translating 2D illusions to VR highlighted comfort concerns; abrupt pop transitions caused discomfort, so we introduced smooth blends.

## Outcome

The resulting sandbox lets instructors and researchers toggle different illusion styles, making it a useful reference for future machine vision and design studies. Full implementation details and evaluation notes live in the linked report.
