## Overview

Impossible Geometry is a design-in-context study produced with Cornell's VR studio. Our team translated Escher-inspired illusions into interactive 3D sculptures using Unreal Engine 4/5, then evaluated how they might inform machine vision, spatial design, and future storytelling tools.

## Research Motivation

- **Perceptual roots:** Interviews with perception psychologist David Fields highlighted how uncanny spaces arise when expected right angles, shading, or scale cues conflict with reality.
- **Local vs. global consistency:** We formalized impossible geometry by separating objects into layers (foreground, mid, background). While each layer maintains a valid relationship locally, the loop becomes globally inconsistent—an insight we derived from comparing regular cubes with impossible cubes and triangles.
- **Design implications:** Violating the “Central Dogma” of projection (3D → 2D) enables new narrative possibilities and challenges sketch-to-model pipelines that assume Euclidean consistency.

## Unreal Implementation

- Split the cube into three mesh layers and attached a Scene Capture component to the player camera.
- Streamed only the background layer (occluded by the mid-layer) to a render target via Unreal’s custom depth settings.
- Converted that capture into a black-and-white opacity mask applied to the foreground material so the background convincingly "cuts through" when seen from the cone of illusion.
- Explored both UE4 and UE5 pipelines—UE5’s Lumen global illumination delivered richer bounce light but also exposed the illusion more readily.

## Indicators & Findings

- **Lighting cues:** Shadows, indirect lighting, and relative scale reveal when the background truly sits behind the foreground. Flattened lighting hides the trick; matching these indicators to the illusion is a key next step.
- **Breaking points:** Leaving the cone of illusion exposes seams where layers join. Those intersections mimic the classic impossible triangle, suggesting a shared governing rule we can generalize.
- **VR translation:** Stereo rendering requires distinct masks per eye. Without eye-tracked, view-dependent adjustments the illusion collapses—an opportunity for foveated rendering research.
