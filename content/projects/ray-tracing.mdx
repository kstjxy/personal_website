**This is a course project for CS4620: Intro to Computer Graphics at Cornell University. I wrote a ray tracing algorithm in Python and ultimately rendered a chessboard as the final product.**

### Features

#### Geometric Primitives

This ray tracing algorithm supports rendering five different geometric primitives:

- Sphere
- Triangle
- Cylinder
- Cone
- Plane

Each primitive has a corresponding class to store its data and an intersect function.

#### Light Sources

This ray tracing algorithm supports both Point Light and Ambient Light, as well as a mirror reflection effect.

### Texture Mapping

I introduced checkerboard texture mapping by creating a Texture Class and modifying the Material class and shade function. The Texture Class features functions to initialize the checkerboard texture with a specified height, width, and two distinct colored materials. It also includes a function to determine the material based on the hitpoint’s position. During shading, if the hit material has a texture, I use the Texture class function to update the hit material with the corresponding material.

### Obj Loader

I introduced 3 different obj files for the chess structures – the horse head, the cross, and the fortress head. All of them are built in Fusion 360 and converted to the desired obj file format through Blender.

Additionally, I set up our scene in Blender as a reference for camera and model locations.
