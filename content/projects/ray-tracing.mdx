## Overview

For CS4620 I wrote a CPU ray tracer in Python, then modeled a chess vignette to stress-test the pipeline. The renderer handles multiple primitives, hierarchical transforms, and material effects so I could focus on lighting and composition.

## Rendering Features

- **Primitives:** Sphere, triangle, cylinder, cone, and plane classes with dedicated intersection routines.
- **Lighting:** Ambient + point lights with Phong shading and recursive mirror reflections.
- **Materials:** Checkerboard texture sampler that swaps material properties based on UV position.
- **Mesh loader:** Imported Fusion 360 assets via Blender-exported OBJ files for rooks, knights, and crosses.

## Implementation Notes

- Structured each primitive as a Python dataclass with a shared `intersect(ray)` signature.
- Built a shading pipeline that resolves surface normals, runs texture lookup, then blends diffuse/specular terms.
- Authored Blender reference scenes to match camera framing and place imported models accurately.
