## Overview

LibGDX ships without higher-level tools for drawing and manipulating polygons. To unblock our workflow, I ported Cornell's CUGL geometry module into LibGDX and wrapped it with an interactive demo suite. The toolkit now covers polyline authoring, extrusion, smoothing, and spline generation directly in engine.

## Demo States

- **PolyFactory:** Quick-build Poly2 shapes (triangles, arcs, rounded rectangles) and preview them as textured polygon regions.
- **PathFactory:** Generate Path2 skeletons and extrude them into hollow geometry using the SimpleExtruder helper.
- **Extruder settings:** Toggle join/end caps to evaluate how profiles render when swept into solids.
- **PathSmoother:** Draw freehand curves, then apply Douglas–Peucker simplification to reduce nodes while preserving silhouette.
- **Spline:** Place anchor points that convert to Spline2 curves, back into paths, and finally to renderable polygons.

## Key Classes

- **Path2:** Core polyline container with winding checks, containment tests, scale/translate utilities, and slice operations.
- **Poly2:** Triangulated polygon representation with boundary detection, mesh adjacency, and transformation helpers.
- **Spline2 & SplinePather:** Author cubic Bézier splines, then convert them through SplinePather → Path2 → SimpleExtruder → Poly2.
- **PathFactory & PolyFactory:** Convenience constructors for common primitives with configurable dimensions and offsets.
- **PathSmoother & SimpleExtruder:** Utility classes that smooth user input and create solid meshes from open paths.
