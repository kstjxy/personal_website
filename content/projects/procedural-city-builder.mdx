# Procedural City Builder

A comprehensive city simulation featuring advanced procedural generation and complex economic modeling.

## Key Systems
- **Procedural road networks**: Realistic street layouts based on terrain and zoning
- **Dynamic economic simulation**: Supply and demand affecting city growth
- **Population growth modeling**: Realistic demographic changes over time
- **Environmental impact systems**: Climate and pollution affecting development

## Technical Achievements
- 100,000+ concurrent citizens
- Real-time traffic simulation
- Weather and seasonal systems
- Multi-threaded architecture for smooth performance

## Procedural Generation
The system uses Voronoi diagrams and noise functions to create organic city layouts that feel naturally developed over time.

## Economic Modeling
Features complex supply chains where residential, commercial, and industrial zones interact dynamically, creating emergent gameplay scenarios.
