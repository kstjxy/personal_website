## Overview

**Unity Minecraft** is a semester project for Cornell's CS4621 Graphics Practicum. We rebuilt the core Minecraft loop with modern rendering, smoother controls, and livelier simulation. I co-led engineering for world generation, performance tuning, and interaction polish alongside four teammates.

- **Engine:** Unity HDRP on PC with a third-person camera.
- **Timeline:** 14 weeks with a five-person team (two programmers, two technical artists, one designer).

## World & Visuals

Highlights from the environment stack:

- **Procedural biomes:** Layered Perlin noise keeps voxel terrain and foliage transitions seamless.
- **Dynamic sky:** Ray-marched volumetric clouds, day/night progression, and sunlight scattering.
- **Weather shaders:** Rain, puddles, and wet-surface reflections scale with storm intensity.
- **Material library:** PBR textures power animated water, sand displacement, and emissive blocks.

Optimized chunk streaming and greedy meshing hold 60+ FPS even while sprinting across the map, while cascaded shadows and SSAO keep the scenes cohesive without overwhelming mid-range GPUs.

## Gameplay Systems

Exploration systems tie the world together:

- **Toolbar canvas:** Unified crafting, equipment, and block placement for controller or mouse.
- **Dig & build toolkit:** Real-time carving, block placement, and reusable macros for structures.
- **Flocking AI:** Patrol behaviors that respond to player proximity and environmental hazards.
- **Resource spawners:** Per-biome tunables for ore, flora, wildlife, and ambient events.

## My Contributions

My focus areas:

- **World streaming:** Voxel data generation, greedy meshing, and GPU instancing for steady 60 FPS.
- **Environment simulation:** Day/night cycle, volumetric clouds, and weather triggers wired to gameplay.
- **Interaction design:** Third-person controller, navigation smoothing, and toolbar UX that keeps building fast.

The result is a Minecraft homage with modern rendering and responsive tools that still feels approachable for future contributors.
