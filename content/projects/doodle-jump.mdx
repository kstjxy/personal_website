The gameplay focuses on maneuvering the character based on accelerometer angle readings. Key features include a robust update loop, dynamic platform generation, and collision handling. I conducted thorough testing on both the gameâ€™s mechanics and its hardware integration.**For more information, please visit our project page:**[READ MORE >>](https://nicepage.com/c/education-website-mockup)**
