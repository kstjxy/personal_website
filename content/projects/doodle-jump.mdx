## Overview

Doodle Jump started as a hardware experiment: we piped FRDM-KL46Z accelerometer values over UART into a LibGDX + Box2D build so tilting the board moves the character. The result is a tactile homage that keeps the frantic vertical gameplay while highlighting embedded input.

## Hardware Integration

- Parsed accelerometer angles at 60 Hz and mapped them to Box2D impulses.
- Implemented calibration routines to zero out drift and clamp tilt extremes.
- Added serial connection guards so the game falls back to keyboard if the board disconnects.

## Gameplay Systems

- **Procedural platforms:** Weighted random generation of normal, moving, and breaking platforms.
- **Collision handling:** Custom contact listeners to trigger bounces, springs, and enemy knockouts.
- **State loop:** Pause/resume logic tied to hardware input so the board becomes the primary controller.

## My Role

- Led the hardware-software integration, including UART parsing and smoothing filters.
- Built the Box2D character controller and tuned physics constants for a springy feel.
- Authored QA checklists to verify latency, collision stability, and backup keyboard controls.
