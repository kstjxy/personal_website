## Overview

Tilly's Critter Command is a Pikmin-inspired RTS created by the Cornell DGA executive team. Players channel emotions to command expressive animals against apathetic robots. We expect to wrap production in spring 2024 after a year of iterative playtests.

## Emotion-Driven Strategy

- **Emotion Manipulator:** Project joy to recruit neutral creatures or anger to send the pack charging at a threat.
- **Momentum:** Capturing enemy bases cuts off robot reinforcements, while losing your own bases cascades into defeat.
- **World tone:** Hand-painted biomes and expressive animations reinforce the story of rediscovering feeling.

## Unit Roster

- **Dogs:** Supportive melee units that buff nearby allies.
- **Cats:** Lone fighters that spike damage when isolated.
- **Rams:** Siege specialists that melt bases.
- **Parrots:** Emotion amplifiers that spread whatever feeling you cast.
- **Robotic foes:** Crab, ant, scorpion, and rhino beetle bots bring their own movement speeds and attack patterns.

## My Contributions

- Built the enemy base system with spawn-weight controls and active enemy caps.
- Authored the inheritance tree for all enemy behaviors, wiring NavMesh agents with state-driven AI.
- Solved crowding by toggling NavMeshAgent/NavMeshObstacle components to carve space when enemies idle.
- Partnered with design on level layouts and encounter pacing as the project pushes toward release.
