## Overview

Nomester Truck is our CS3152: Introduction to Game Architecture capstone. The pitch: keep a ravenous monster truck satisfied by cooking on the fly while sneaking past threats. We shipped a LibGDX title that blends time-pressured cooking with tactical route planning.

## Core Loop

- **Cook fast:** Chop, sear, and boil ingredients to keep the truck obedient.
- **Chart a path:** Spend dishes to move, rotate, or distract enemies guarding the forest.
- **Adapt recipes:** Mix ingredient modifiers to earn temporary buffs or ranged distractions.

## Level Design

- Authored all eight tutorial levels plus half of the 17 campaign stages.
- Built encounter patterns that emphasize two pillars: frantic multitasking and deliberate planning.
- Crafted progression that teaches recipe timing, patrolling enemy reads, and resource trade-offs.

## UX & Systems

- Designed the kitchen HUD and truck control panels, iterating on wireframes to keep timers legible.
- Produced screenflow and CRC diagrams that aligned the team on module boundaries.
- Implemented core modules: scene transitions, truck AI state machine, and cooking interactions.
