<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

Nomester Truck is a creative endeavor for CS3152: Introduction to Game Architecture at Cornell University, and marks my debut in game development. In this project, completed in May 2022, I took on the roles of a programmer and level designer, utilizing LibGDX, a robust and open‑source game‑development framework written in Java. This experience was more than a course requirement; it was a journey into the heart of game design, where I learned the intricacies of game architecture and the development cycle. It ignited my passion for the gaming industry and showcased my skills in both programming and design (level/UX), thus making it a pivotal milestone in my personal and professional growth.

Features

- Chop, sear, and boil ingredients to fulfill the truck’s monstrous appetite
- Compel the truck to drive by swiftly completing recipes to feed the truck
- Launch completed meals to lure enemies away from the truck
- Supercharge the truck with powerful abilities by experimenting with new recipes
- Evade enemies by strategically planning a safe route to the exit

<h2 id="my-duties">My Duties</h2>

### Level & Tutorial design

Our game features a total of 25 levels (including 8 tutorial levels). I was responsible for designing all the tutorial levels and half of the main levels. In the initial phase of level construction, I focused on two key design philosophies:

- Hectic Gameplay: fast‑paced, urgent action, mirroring the high‑pressure environment of cooking in a fantastical setting. Players must quickly prepare meals and navigate dangers, fostering an exciting atmosphere that demands quick thinking and efficient decision‑making.
- Strategic Planning: thoughtful decision‑making, where players plan their actions, from choosing recipes to plotting safe routes and using meals to distract enemies. It adds depth to the game, encouraging a smart, tactical approach to complement the fast‑paced gameplay.

I also contributed to gameplay programming (Java/LibGDX) and tools/scripting to speed iteration.
