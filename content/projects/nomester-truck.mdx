## Core Vision

As the owner of a hungry and impatient monster food truck, the player must cook to appease the truck, then decide when to move, rotate, or distract enemies. The experience mixes the frantic cadence of a real‑time kitchen with thoughtful, turn‑by‑turn positioning. The core tension comes from juggling recipes under pressure while plotting a safe route to the exit.

## Core Loop

- **Cook fast:** Chop, sear, and boil ingredients to keep the truck obedient.
- **Chart a path:** Spend dishes to move, rotate, or distract enemies guarding the forest.
- **Adapt recipes:** Mix ingredient modifiers to earn temporary buffs or ranged distractions.

## Core Mechanics

- Chop, sear, and boil ingredients to fulfill the truck’s monstrous appetite
- Compel the truck to drive by swiftly completing recipes to feed the truck
- Launch completed meals to lure enemies away from the truck
- Supercharge the truck with powerful abilities by experimenting with new recipes
- Evade enemies by strategically planning a safe route to the exit

## Level Design

- Authored all eight tutorial levels plus half of the 17 campaign stages.
- Built encounter patterns that emphasize two pillars: frantic multitasking and deliberate planning.
- Crafted progression that teaches recipe timing, patrolling enemy reads, and resource trade-offs.

## UX & Systems

- Designed the kitchen HUD and truck control panels, iterating on wireframes to keep timers legible.
- Produced screenflow and CRC diagrams that aligned the team on module boundaries.
- Implemented core modules: scene transitions, truck AI state machine, and cooking interactions.

## Architecture

We documented the codebase with dependency diagrams and CRC cards to keep the team aligned. Systems are split across presentation (screens and HUD), simulation (truck controller, enemy AI, recipes), and utilities (pathfinding, level loading). The diagram above captures the major relationships used to keep cooking, movement, and enemy behavior decoupled.
