  Nomester Truck is a creative endeavor for CS3152: Introduction to Game Architecture at Cornell
  University, and marks my debut in game development. In this project, completed in May 2022, I took
  on the roles of a programmer and level designer, utilizing LibGDX, a robust and open‑source
  game‑development framework written in Java. This experience was more than a course requirement; it
  was a journey into the heart of game design, where I learned the intricacies of game architecture
  and the development cycle. It ignited my passion for the gaming industry and showcased my skills
  in both programming and design (level/UX), thus making it a pivotal milestone in my personal and
  professional growth.

<h2 id="game-details">Game Details</h2>

- 2D arcade‑style gameplay with whimsical characters
- Built on LibGDX with custom systems for input, physics, and level scripting
- Deployed cross‑platform with desktop builds and in‑class showcase

### Core Vision

As the owner of a hungry and impatient monster food truck, Nomster Truck, the player must feed the truck to avoid enemies and navigate through an enchanted forest full of impending danger to return home. The game has both cooking and strategic elements, where the player must cook and decide whether to appease the truck to move, turn and/or distract enemies. The player experiences the frantic movement of a real‑time game while also strategically plotting out turns like in traditional board games. The player will need to find a balance between swiftly completing recipes and planning out their path to the exit.

### Features

- Chop, sear, and boil ingredients to fulfill the truck’s monstrous appetite
- Compel the truck to drive by swiftly completing recipes to feed the truck
- Launch completed meals to lure enemies away from the truck
- Supercharge the truck with powerful abilities by experimenting with new recipes
- Evade enemies by strategically planning a safe route to the exit

<h2 id="my-duties">My Duties</h2>

### Level & Tutorial design

Our game features a total of 25 levels (including 8 tutorial levels). I was responsible for designing all the tutorial levels and half of the main levels. In the initial phase of level construction, I focused on two key design philosophies:

- Hectic Gameplay: fast‑paced, urgent action, mirroring the high‑pressure environment of cooking in a fantastical setting. Players must quickly prepare meals and navigate dangers, fostering an exciting atmosphere that demands quick thinking and efficient decision‑making.
- Strategic Planning: thoughtful decision‑making, where players plan their actions, from choosing recipes to plotting safe routes and using meals to distract enemies. It adds depth to the game, encouraging a smart, tactical approach to complement the fast‑paced gameplay.

I also contributed to gameplay programming (Java/LibGDX) and tools/scripting to speed iteration.

<h2 id="ux-design">UX design</h2>

I was involved in several UX design tasks, primarily focusing on the main menu display and the kitchen layout. Presented here are the final design of the main menu screen and an early sketch from the initial stages of game development:

<h2 id="architecture-spec">Architecture Specification</h2>

I played a significant role in the development of our game’s architecture specification. This included creating detailed dependency diagrams and CRC (Class‑Responsibility‑Collaboration) cards. These tools were essential in providing our development team with a clear understanding of the coding structure, thereby streamlining the development process and facilitating easier collaboration.

      Finally, my primary responsibilities as a programmer included developing key game modules.
      This encompassed managing screen transitions, formulating the logic behind enemy and truck
      movements, and creating the comprehensive cooking mechanics that form the core of the gameplay
      experience.
