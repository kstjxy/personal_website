## Overview

Sunk Cost is a head-to-head RTS/stealth experience built in the Cornell University Game Library. A diver invades a haunted ship while the resident spirit lays traps. The project ran for three months and earned the 2023 Cornell GDIAC Audience Favorite award.

## Experience Goals

- **Dual perspectives:** One player sneaks through the ship in real time; the other orchestrates defenses from a tactical view.
- **Underwater tension:** Audio, lighting, and narrative logs build dread as the diver hunts for relics.
- **Mobile ready:** Built with CUGL to target both iOS and Android tablets.

## Core Mechanics

- **Hunter:** Sneak between cover, disable traps, and escape with treasure before oxygen runs out.
- **Spirit:** Deploy surveillance portraits, trigger traps, and manipulate doors to stall the hunter.
- **Shared systems:** Server-authoritative networking with deterministic timers keeps both roles synchronized.

## My Contributions

- **Level design:** Assembled the final Tiled map from designer tilesets, then wrote adapters to stream JSON layouts into the engine.
- **Architecture:** Produced MVC dependency diagrams and CRC cards that guided module ownership across the programming pod.
- **Spirit mechanics:** Implemented the four signature spirit abilities (possessions, trap triggers, decoys, and ultimate lockdown) plus their animation hooks.
- **Team leadership:** Coordinated the eight-person crew, resolved merge conflicts, and aligned gameplay cadence with art deliverables.
