## Overview

Sunk Cost is a head-to-head RTS/stealth experience built in the Cornell University Game Library. A diver invades a haunted ship while the resident spirit lays traps. The project ran for three months and earned the 2023 Cornell GDIAC Audience Favorite award.

## Experience Goals

- **Dual perspectives:** One player sneaks through the ship in real time; the other orchestrates defenses from a tactical view.
- **Underwater tension:** Audio, lighting, and narrative logs build dread as the diver hunts for relics.
- **Mobile ready:** Built with CUGL to target both iOS and Android tablets.

        A Treasure Hunter dives to the ocean deep, seeking riches beyond their wildest dreams.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3 text-base leading-relaxed text-foreground">
        An ancient shipwreck appears to offer the Hunter refuge from the swirling waters, and
        potential for an easy score… or so they thought.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3 text-base leading-relaxed text-foreground">
        They enter, unaware that the ship is controlled by a malicious Spirit, treading upon the
        submerged graveyard of the former crew.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-foreground">
        The Spirit will do anything to ensure none who lays their eyes on the treasure leaves the
        ship alive…

# My Contributions

- **Level design:** Assembled the final Tiled map from designer tilesets, then wrote adapters to stream JSON layouts into the engine.
  <img src={imgMapEditor} alt="Tiled map editor with assembled tilesets" />
- **Architecture:** Produced MVC dependency diagrams and CRC cards that guided module ownership across the programming pod.
- **Spirit mechanics:** Implemented the four signature spirit abilities (possessions, trap triggers, decoys, and ultimate lockdown) plus their animation hooks.
- **Team leadership:** Coordinated the eight-person crew, resolved merge conflicts, and aligned gameplay cadence with art deliverables.
