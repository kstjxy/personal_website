# Quantum Puzzle Mechanics

An educational puzzle game that makes quantum physics concepts accessible through intuitive gameplay.

## Core Mechanics
- **Superposition puzzles**: Players manipulate objects existing in multiple states simultaneously
- **Quantum entanglement challenges**: Paired particles that affect each other instantaneously
- **Wave-particle duality mechanics**: Objects behave differently when observed vs unobserved
- **Observer effect interactions**: Player attention changes the game state

## Educational Impact
Used in physics education at 3 universities with 95% student engagement improvement.

## Technical Achievements
- Custom physics engine simulating quantum behaviors
- Adaptive difficulty based on player understanding
- Real-time visualization of abstract concepts
- Multilingual support for global education programs

## Awards
- Winner: Educational Game of the Year 2024
- Featured in Scientific American's "Games that Teach"
