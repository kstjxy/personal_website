## Overview

For the CS4620: Intro to Computer Graphics final, our team rebuilt Pac-Man in 3D using Cornell's AniGraph framework built on top of Three.js. We rebalanced classic mechanics with new rendering tech—stylized shading, volumetric effects, and smarter enemy behaviors—to keep the original spirit while showcasing a modern pipeline.

## Gameplay & Visual Highlights

- **Stylized look:** Custom toon shading, billboard particles, and emissive power-ups give the maze a saturated arcade feel.
- **Fluid motion:** Authored animation clips and cinematic camera rails to keep Pac-Man readable during fast corners.
- **Procedural mazes:** Each session generates a new layout, mixing destructible glass walls, portals, and flame hazards.
- **Adaptive ghosts:** Ghosts share navigation data and switch behaviors based on player state (chase, scatter, flee).

## My Contributions

- Integrated AniGraph rendering features—lighting, toon shading, and particle emitters—on top of Three.js primitives.
- Prototyped the procedural maze generator and tuned parameters for reliable spawn/goal placement.
- Implemented camera rigs, character controllers, and event hooks that drive ghost AI state changes.
