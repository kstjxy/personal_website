**This project is a final submission for the course CS4620: Intro to Computer Graphics at Cornell University. We developed a 3D version of the Pac-Man game using AniGraph, a package designed to facilitate cool cross-platform assignments, and Three.js. In this version, we have introduced new rules to the classic game, including flame effects and semi-transparent blocks that can be eliminated.**Key featrues include:

- **Toon Shading:** We implemented custom shading to give the game a cartoon-like appearance.
- **Character Animation:** Enhanced the gaming experience with fluid and dynamic character movements.
- **Camera Movement:** Implemented versatile camera controls for an immersive gameplay experience.
- **Procedurally Generated Maze:** The maze in our game is generated procedurally, offering a unique layout for each game session.
- **BillBoard Particle System:** This system adds realistic 3D effects to the game’s visual elements.
- **Enemy AI Logic:** Our enemies are powered by AI algorithm, making them smarter and more challenging.
- **Various Interaction Modes:** We included different modes of interaction to increase the game’s replay value.
